### "You don't own this claim!"
- Only owner can modify claim
- Check owner with `/claim info`

### Commands not working
- Ensure claim block is placed
- Stand inside claim area
- Check spelling of command

### Fire still spreading
- Make sure flag is set: `/claim flag fire deny`
- Existing fire needs manual extinguish
- New fire will auto-remove
